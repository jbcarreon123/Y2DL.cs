# YouTube2DiscordLink (formerly YTSCTD)
Gets channel info from one or multiple channels, and sends it on a Text channel or on a Voice channel.

## Currently work in progress!
But, if you want to see updates, and have a idea for a feature of Y2DL,
you can go to my discord at https://discord.gg/P5ecFZNyCc, in the #y2dl channel.
